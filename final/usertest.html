					<h2>Test User 1: Erika</h2>
					<p>Users would read the rules of the game carefully and found out that the total score of the game was not the same as in the rules. Every function button was tested throughout the process and was working.</p>

					<h2>Test User 2: Jaime</h2>
					<p>Users were interested in playing the game several times and are interested in the design of the dice. But the mouse paused at the start button on the first screen, and seemed to be a bit confused about the special effects of the start button.</p>

					<h2>Test User 3:Joanna</h2>
					<p>Users tested all the function buttons, but ignored the arrow icon on the third game screen. For the final screen congratulating the player for winning the game, there is confusion about who the winner is. The user tries to click on each bonus icon and finds that it is just the icon.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For the user test results, I will adjust the start button on the first screen so that the interaction will be activated only when the user's mouse is in the range of the start button. This will make its functionality more clear to the user. I would remove the arrow button from the third screen of the game and add a back button to avoid the user being confused about how to return to the game rules screen. I will adjust the final bonus screen to keep only the player's image and remove the other two bonus items. This will make it clearer to the user who the winner is and prevent the user from thinking that the bonus items are clickable. Finally, I will double check all the function buttons and text content.
