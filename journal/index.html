            <h2>9 Photo Composition Tips, As Seen in Photographs by Steve McCurry</h2>

              </figure>
            <p>This image is one of my favorites because my cat is very cute at this time, and he usually rarely shows this pose, so I recorded this moment. This picture shows the cat reclining on my bed looking up and contains some space for
            association. For example, is he asking me for a snack, or petting him. It could also be that he is trying to sleep and wants to see what I am doing before he goes to bed. This image is one of my collection of cats showing a very lazy pose, which can be connected to other photos by the state of the cat. These photos can show the cat's trust in me and his freedom to come and go anywhere in the house, including occupying my bed. I have a lot of interesting stories with him and he is a very smart cat.</p>

                <figcaption>Fig.2 - Afrah, Toolbox</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p> This is Afrah and her collection of images showing a blue box with some tools used for painting. The interesting thing about this picture is the color scheme, the rectangular blue box guides the eye into the picture and observes the contents of the box. The box contains some paints for drawing, such as red, blue, and white. Some of these are obvious to see what brand of paint Afrah uses, but the usefulness of some of the bottles in the box caused my curiosity.And there seems to be a cute Airpods in the bottom left of the picture. The most mysterious part is how Afrah intends to use these tools, and where she makes her art. It reminded me of a story where she walks around the lake at school listening to music, then looks for a perfect spot and opens her toolbox to create a painting.</p>

            <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>
            <h3><date>February 07, 2023</date></h3>
        <article>
            <p>After reading the article on <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>,I find that all of these images allow the viewer to develop their own mind based on what they are observing and can relate to different stories.  For example, in the third image, someone observes a man in some kind of sewer that looks like he is seeking refuge from the police. But I can assume that he may be hiding from the police and fell into the sewer.</p>

            <p>There are many teachers who ask students to observe what is in the pictures for learning purposes. It has been used in many teaching situations, such as learning English or science classes, to start discussions by looking at the images. Designers and artists also get a lot of their inspiration from observation of life. Therefore, visual thinking can help us a lot in our respective professional fields.</p>

            <p>When I was exploring the Awwwards.com website, I found a very interesting interactive site <a href="https://summer-afternoon.vlucendo.com/">Summer Afternoon</a>. This site uses the web experimentation program 3d art to create an interactive game. This experiment was inspired by summer afternoons and it is very relevant to life. The overall effect of the environment gives the user a comfortable feeling and allows the user to find five hidden secrets in this environment. It is a very attractive interaction design and the game can be used to stimulate the user's visual mind to find the secrets.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
            <h3><date>February 09, 2023</date></h3>
        <article>
            <p>After reading the article on <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, I realized that dialogs are only used when you want to draw the user's attention to more important things. Otherwise, users will just get annoyed with your page design. Or you can use it when you want to prompt the user for some other information. I think modals windows are useful for popping up when a user actively clicks to register for an account. This allows the user to focus only on registering for an account and reduces the scope for the user to move the mouse to the bottom right corner of the page. Especially if they are not using the mouse, they can reduce the range of mouse movement.
            </p>

            <p>I've experienced many shopping sites that have pop-up window when you are browsing the web. For example, asking users to sign up for an account or asking them to enter their email address to subscribe to their brand's news to get a 10% discount.These ad pushes take more time for me to close it and some sites have modal windows that I can't find where to close it. As mentioned in the article, I've been trained to close these windows instinctively. I don't think it's a good idea to have a promotional window pop up when a user enters a shopping page. Because many users will only think about the 10% discount and look for it when they check out. So putting the discount information at the top of the page is a good way.</p>

            <p>The size and location of the modal windows is also important as mentioned in the article. Positioning in the top half of the screen is optimal and the size should not exceed 50%. I also noticed in the article that the background of the example image is darkened when the modal window is displayed. This is a very useful tip. It will not make the user feel that there is too much information. And the designer needs to avoid the system to automatically launch the modal window, which will interrupt the user's current task.</p>

            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <h3><date>January 31, 2023</date></h3>

            <article>        
            <p>After reading articles on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, I learned many examples of mistakes that can be avoided when I design forms. And I realized that the primary focus of form design is that you need to reduce the cognitive load on the user so that they are willing to fill out the form. Then you can move on to more detailed design. Otherwise it would all be meaningless. I think a user usage survey would be a very useful step in the design process. The article mentions breaking the form into multiple steps and combining them into one big form, which is also an important point I learned. When I was shopping I experienced many form sites that used this similar design. As a user, this design makes the form very clear and simple for me.
            </p>

            <p>The article talks about the one-column layout, and I think the one-column layout is the most efficient design. Because it allows users to fill in information clearly and does not easily confuse them. For example, if the address information is designed to fill in the boxes in the same row, it may cause the user to be confused. I have encountered this problem, I often get confused when I should write my apartment number first or in front of the city. If the layout is single column and it shows the option of address 2. I know exactly where I should put my apartment number in the address 2 box. And the form would also insert explanatory text to guide the user to enter the correct content.
            </p>

            <p>We experience many form designs in our daily life, and their general design is similar, but there are many different details. Often these details are the most direct response to the user experience. For example, I think <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/?ref=212&loc=1&gclid=CjwKCAiArNOeBhAHEiwAze_nKMQVxr1XbIKRiN2pIzrxAE35Ydz9gbmtSECwuGagFmALWjzgQnc0hBoCr8AQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Best Buy</a> embodies best practices. The form is very clear and the user can easily know what they need. The details of the account form are designed with text tips. The entire form design including field sizes, color schemes, and labels are very specific. It gives the user a very good experience. So I think best buy is a good example of form design practice.
